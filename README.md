# I'm an Android dev now. 
&ensp;&ensp; I'm finally able to work on the things I am passionate about, incorporating system components and applying low-level concepts such as multi-threading, in order to build something new and useful.</br>
&ensp;&ensp; Although the scale is smaller than that of full-blown computer programs and web apps, I am able to get a taste of every aspect of application development from designing UI to optimizing business logic and the app architecture instead of focusing on either the front or backend which I enjoy a lot.
